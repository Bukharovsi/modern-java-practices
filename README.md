# Modern Java Build Practices

[![build](https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/actions)
[![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/binkley/modern-java-practices.svg)](https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices/issues/)
[![Public Domain](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Public%20Domain-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

**Modern Java Build Practices** is an article on bootstrapping modern Java/JVM
projects with sample builds for Gradle and Maven, and a focus on
_hygiene_ and best practices.

**NB** &mdash; This is a "work in progress". Much of it is bullet points,
intending to flesh these out to full-written sections.

**NB** &mdash; This sample project has both Gradle and Maven builds. Most
IDEs, _eg_, IntelliJ, may have issues with more than one way to build the
code; [command-line](#project-setup)
and [Batect](#keep-local-consistent-with-ci) usage work as expected.

**NB** &mdash; The sample Gradle and Maven build scripts often specify
specific versions of the tooling, separate from the plugin versions. This is
intentional. You should be able to update a tooling version to the latest even
when the plugin has not yet caught up.

Try out the builds:

```
$ ./gradlew build
# Output ommitted
$ ./mvnw verify
# Output omitted
```

## Introduction

Hi!  I want you to have _awesome builds_. If you're on Java or a JVM project (
Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, JRuby, _et al_), this article is for you.

My purpose is to highlight and provide examples for building modern Java/JVM
projects with Gradle or Maven. The article focuses on Java, but many points
apply to _any_ JVM language build (well, perhaps not language code style).

This project has simple goals:

* Quick solutions for raising project quality and security in your build
* Starters for Modern use of Java/JVM builds
* Focused on Gradle or Maven

I don't discuss alternative starter tools. This article helps you spin up a
new Gradle or Maven project directly. For example, you may
find [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io),
[`mn` from Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/), or
[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) (among others) more to your liking.
That's great!  I believe this article still provides build help for you
beyond "getting started". You can pick and choose build features to add to
your starter project.

The goal: [_Make people awesome_](https://modernagile.org/). I've tried a lot
of things with Gradle and Maven builds, and want to share lessons learned with
you.

---

## Your project

There are several helpful steps in setting up a new project, or in
refurbishing an existing project. Some things to strive for in your projects:

* Visitors and new developers get off to a quick start, and can understand
  what the build does (if they are interested)
* Users of your project trust it&mdash;the build does what it says on the
  tin&mdash;, and they feel safe relying on your project
* You don't get peppered with questions that are answered "in the source"
  &mdash;because not everyone wants to read the source, and you'd rather be
  coding than answering questions â˜º
* Coding should feel easy. Problems you solve are _real_ problems, not
  nuisances because of tools or plugins. Your code demonstrably provides value
  to others, and the build supports you
* Your code passes all the "smell tests": no simple complaints, and you aren't
  embarrassed when folks look over the code. Hey! You're a professional, and
  it shows. (This is one of my personal fears as a programmer)

## Getting started

To get a project off to a good start, consider these items. Even for existing
projects, you an address these as you go along or while refurbishing an
existing project:

* **Team agreement comes first**. Make sure everyone is onboard and clear on
  what build standards are, and understands&mdash;at least as an
  outline&mdash;what the build does for them
* Provide a *good* `README.md`. This saves you a ton of time in the long run.
  This is your _most important_ step. A good resource is Yegor's
  [_Elegant READMEs_](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html)
  .
  [YMMV](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Y/Your-mileage-may-vary.html)
    * [Intelligent laziness is a virtue](http://threevirtues.com/). Time
      invested in good documentation pays off
    * A good [`README.md`](./README.md) answers visitors questions, so you
      don't spend time answering trivial questions, and explains/justifies
      your project to others.
      Fight [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
      with communication!
* Use build wrappers committed into the project root:
    * Build wrappers are shell scripts to run Gradle or Maven. The wrapper
      takes care of downloading needed tools without getting in the way. New
      contributors and developers can start right away; they do not need to
      install more software
    * For Gradle, use
      [`./gradlew`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
      (part of Gradle)
    * For Maven, use [`./mvnw`](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper)
      (in progress with Apache to bundle as part of Maven)
* Always run CI on push to a shared repository. It's a sad panda when someone
  is excited about their commit, and then the commit breaks the other
  developers
    * In CI, use caches for dependency downloads; this speeds up the feedback
      cycle from CI (see [below](#setup-ci))
    * When sensible, move code quality and security checks into local builds
      before changes hit CI (see [below](#setup-local-ci))

**TODO**: These bits go into other sections

* Build plugin customizations goes in `config/` (see [Lombok](#lombok) for an
  exception)
* Do not commit IDE files except in specific circumstances
    * Discuss `.editorconfig`
    * Discuss IDE config sharing options
* Pick a common code style, and stay consistent; update tooling to complain on
  style violations
    * Discuss variances in style -- Sun, Google, etc
    * See [Use linting](#use-linting)
* IDE plugins:
    * See **TODO** to move IDE concerns to their own section
    * Team consistency
    * Help for Gradle/Maven plugins

## The JDK

**TODO** Bleh, just dumping here. Need discussion
**TODO** Clarify language around JEnv -- not the JDK, a tool for picking an
environment

* Do not use a JDK older than version 11
    * **TODO**: Discuss OpenJDK
    * **TODO**: Discuss Oracle roadmap on Java
    * **TODO**: Discuss tradeoffs between LTS version and newer JDK versions
* [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/) or equivalent

### OpenJDK

* **TODO**: Discuss Oracle LTS, and role of OpenJDK
* **TODO**: Discuss [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* Avoid Java 8 or older: No longer supported, etc.
* Java 11 is "old" (this is a relative term) but solid and supported
* Java 15 is the current LTS version

These demonstration projects use Java 11 as tooling has not yet caught up to
the recently released Java 15.

---

## Use Gradle or Maven

Projects using Ant should be updated. The choice between Maven and Gradle
depends on the team, and other factors. Ant is outdated, and does not support
modern tooling.  **Consider Ant builds no longer supported, and a form of
[Tech Debt](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html).**

There are alternative build choices for specific projects and circumstances
such as [Buck](https://buck.build) (related to [Bazel](https://bazel.build)),
et al. This article focuses on Gradle and Maven which are considered
"standard" in the JVM community, wide-spread in use, and with much direct and
indirect support for problems.

Throughout when covering both Gradle and Maven, Gradle will be discussed
first, then Maven. This is no expressing a preference!  It is neutral
alphabetical order.

### Tips

* Gradle uses advanced terminal control, so you cannot always see what is
  happening. To view Gradle steps plainly when debugging your build, use:
  ```
  $ ./gradlew <your tasks> | cat
  ```
  or save the output to a file:
  ```
  $ ./gradlew <your tasks> | tee -o some-file
  ```

---

## Keep local consistent with CI

### Setup CI

When using GitHub, a simple starting point is
[`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).  (GitLabs is similar, but as this
project is hosted in GitHub, there is not a simple means to demonstrate CI at
GitLabs). This sample GitHub workflow builds with Gradle, and then with Maven.

### Setup local CI

[Batect](https://batect.dev/) is a cool tool from Charles Korn. With some
setup, it runs your build in a "CI-like" local environment via Docker. This is
one of your first lines of defence against "it runs on my box".

You would not run Batect in your CI pipeline itself: use GitHub Actions
(or GitLab equivalent). Batect is for your local build.

See [`batect.yml`](./batect.yml) to configure. For this project, there are
demonstration targets:

```
$ ./batect build-gradle
# output ommitted
$ ./batect build-maven
# output ommitted
```

---

## Keep build current

**TODO**: Needs discussion

### Keep plugins and dependencies up-to-date

* [Gradle](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)
* [Maven](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/)
* Team agreement about releases only, or if non-release plugins and
  dependencies are acceptable

Example use which shows outdated plugins and dependencies, but does not modify
any project files:

```
$ ./gradlew dependencyUpdates
# output ommitted
$ ./mvnw versions:diplay-property-updates
# output ommitted
```

In this project, version numbers for Gradle are kept in
[`gradle.properties`](./gradle.properties), and for Maven in
[the POM](./pom.xml).

#### More on Gradle version numbers

Your simplest approach to Gradle is to keep everything in `build.gradle`.  
Even this unfortunately still requires a `settings.gradle` to define the
project artifact name, and leaves duplicate version numbers for related
dependencies scattered through `build.gradle`.

Another approach is to rely on a Gradle plugin such as that from Spring Boot
to manage dependencies for you. This unfortunately does not help with plugins
at all, nor with dependencies that Spring Boot does not know about.

This project uses a 3-file solution for Gradle versioning:

* [`gradle.properties`](./gradle.properties) is the sole source of truth for
  version numbers, both plugins and dependencies
* [`settings.gradle`](./settings.gradle) configures plugin versions using the
  properties
* [`build.gradle`](./build.gradle) uses plugins without needing version
  numbers, and dependencies refer to their property versions

So to adjust a version, edit `gradle.properties`. To see this approach in
action for dependencies, try:

```
$ grep junitVersion gradle.properties setttings.gradle build.gradle
gradle.properties:junitVersion=5.7.0
build.gradle:    testImplementation "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:$junitVersion"
build.gradle:    testImplementation "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:$junitVersion"
```

To update Gradle:

```
$ $EDITOR gradle.properties  # Change gradleWrapperVersion property
$ ./gradlew wrapper  # Update
$ ./gradlew wrapper  # Confirm
```

With Gradle, there is no "right" solution for hygienic versioning.

---

## Generate code

When sensible, prefer to generate rather than write code. Here's why:

* [Intelligent laziness is a virtue](http://threevirtues.com/)
* Tools always work, unless they have bugs, and you can fix bugs.  
  Programmers make typos, and fixing typos is a challenge when not obvious.
  Worse are [_thinkos_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thinko); code
  generation does not "think", so is immune to this problem
* Generated code does need code review, only the source input for generation
  needs review, and this is usually shorter and easier to understand.  
  Your hand-written code needs review
* Generated code is usually ignored by tooling such as linting or code
  coverage (and there are simple workarounds when this is not the case). Your
  hand-written code needs tooling to shift problems left

Note that many features for which in Java one would use code generation
(_eg_, Lombok's [`@Getter`](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter)
or [`@ToString`](https://www.projectlombok.org/features/ToString)), can be
built-in language features in other languages such as Kotlin (_eg_,
[properties](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html)
or [data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html)).

### Lombok

[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is by far the most popular tool in Java
for code generation. Lombok is an _annotation processor_, that is, a library (
jar) which cooperates with the Java compiler.  ([_An introductory guide to
annotations and annotation
processors_](https://blog.frankel.ch/introductory-guide-annotation-processor/#handling-annotations-at-compile-time-annotation-processors)
is a good article if you'd like to read more on how annotation processing
works.)

Lombok covers many common use cases, and does not have runtime dependencies,
and there are plugins for popular IDEs to understand Lombok's code generation,
and tooling integration such as provided by JaCoCo code coverage (see
[below](#leverage-lombok-to-tweak-code-coverage)).

#### Leverage Lombok to tweak code coverage

Be sparing in disabling code coverage!  JaCoCo knows about Lombok's
[`@Generated`](https://projectlombok.org/api/lombok/Generated.html), and will
ignore annotated code.

A typical use is for the `main()` method in a framework such as Spring Boot
or [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/). For a _command-line program_, you will
want to test your `main()`.

#### Lombok configuration

[Configure Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration) in
`src/lombok.config` rather than the project root or a separate `config`
directory. At a minimum:

```
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties = true
lombok.extern.findbugs.addSuppressFBWarnings = true
```

Lines:

1. `stopBubbling` tells Lombok that there are no more configuration files
   higher in the directory tree
2. `addLombokGeneratedAnnotation` helps JaCoCo ignore code generated by Lombok
3. `addConstructorProperties` helps JSON/XML frameworks such as Jackson
   (this may not be relevant for your project, but is generally harmless, so
   the benefit comes for free)
4. `addSuppressFBWarnings` helps SpotBugs ignore code generated by Lombok

---

## Use linting

"Linting" is static code analysis with an eye towards style and dodgy code
constructs. The term
[derives from early UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)).

Linting for modern languages is simple: the compiler complains on your behalf.
This is the case, for example, Golang. Having common team agreements on style
and formatting is a boon for avoiding
[bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), and aids in:

* Reading a code base, relying on a similar style throughout
* Code reviews, focusing on substantive over superficial changes
* Merging code, avoiding trivial or irrelevant conflicts

Code style and formatting are _entirely_ a matter of team discussion and
agreement. In Java, there is no recommended style, and `javac` is good at
parsing almost anything thrown at it. However, humans reading code are not as
well-equipped.

**Pick a team style, stick to it, and _enforce_ it with tooling.**

With Java, one needs to rely on external tooling for linting. The most popular
choice is:

* [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/)
    * [Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html)
    * [Maven plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/index.html)

However, unlike built-in solutions, Checkstyle will not auto-format code for
you.

The demonstration projects assume checkstyle configuration at
[`config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`](./config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).  
This is the default location for Gradle, and configured for Maven in this
project.

The Checkstyle configuration used is stock
[`sun_checks.xml`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/sun_checks.xml)
with the addition of support for `@SuppressWarnings(checkstyle:...)`.

### Tips

* If you use Google Java coding conventions, consider
  [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) which can autoformat your
  code.

---

## Use static code analysis

**TODO**: Needs discussion

* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/latest/)
* [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/)

---

## Shift security left

* [Find Security Bugs](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) &mdash; a plugin for
  SpotBugs
* [DependencyCheck](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)

Use checksums and signatures: verify what your project downloads!  When you
publish for consumption by others: provide MD5 (checksum) files in your
upload!  Be a good netizen.

* For Gradle, read more at [_Verifying
  dependencies_](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html)
* For Maven, _always_ run with the `--strict-checksums` (or `-C`) flag. See
  [_Maven Artifact Checksums -
  What?_](https://dev.to/khmarbaise/maven-artifact-checksums---what-396j) for
  more information. This is easy to forget about at the local command line. An
  alias helps:
  ```
  $ alias mvnw=`./mvnw --strict-checksums`
  ```
  However, for CI, this is easy!  The [Batect configuration](./batect.yml)
  on this project says:
  ```yaml
  build-maven:
    description: Build and test with Maven
    run:
      container: build-env
      command: ./mvnw --strict-checksums clean verify
  ```
  and the GitHub action says:
  ```yaml
  - name: Build and test with Maven
    run: ./mvnw --strict-checksums verify
  ```
  ([Batect](#keep-local-consistent-with-ci) and [GitHub Actions](#setup-ci)
  are discussed both above.)

### Tips

* Unfortunately, the Gradle ecosystem is not a mature as the Maven one in this
  regard. For example, if you enable checksum verifications in Gradle, many or
  most of your plugin and dependency downloads fail

---

## The test pyramid

* [_TestPyramid_](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html)
* [_The Practical Test
  Pyramid_](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)

---

## Leverage unit testing and coverage

* [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/)
* "Ratchet" to fail build when coverage drops
* Fluent assertions -- lots of options in this area
    * [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) &mdash; -- solid choice
    * Built assertions from Junit make is difficult for developers to
      distinguish "actual" values from "expected" values. This is a limitation
      from Java as it lacks named parameters

Unit testing and code coverage are foundations for code quality. Your build
should help you with these as much as possible.

Plugins:

* For Gradle this is part of the "java" plugin
* For Maven, use
  the [Maven Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)

(See [_suggestion : Ignore the generated
code_](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/issues/347) for a Lombok/PITest
issue.)

To see the coverage report (on passed or failed coverage), open:

* For Gradle, `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`
* For Maven, `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Tips

* See [discussion on Lombok](#leverage-lombok-to-tweak-code-coverage) how to _
  sparingly_ leverage the `@Generated` annotation for marking code that JaCoCo
  should ignore
* Discuss with your team the concept of a "coverage ratchet". This means, once
  a baseline coverage percentage is agreed to, the build configuration will
  only raise this value, not lower it. This is fairly simple to do by
  periodically examining the JaCoCo report, and raising the build coverage
  percentage over time to match improvements in the report
* Unfortunately neither Gradle's nor Maven's JaCoCo plugin will fail your
  build when coverage _rises_!  This would be helpful for supporting the
  coverage ratchet

---

## Use mutation testing

Unit testing is great for testing your production code. But have you thought
about testing your unit tests? What that means is, how are you sure your tests
really check what you meant them to? Fortunately, there is an automated way to
do just that, no code from you required, only some build configuration.

Mutation testing is a simple concept: Go "break" some production code, and see
if any unit tests fail. Production bytecode is changed during the build&mdash;
for example, an `if (x)` is changed to `if (!x)`&mdash;, and the unit tests
run. With good code coverage, there should now be a failing unit test.

The best option for Java/JVM mutation testing is [PITest](http://pitest.org/).
It is under active development, does some rather clever things with the
production bytecode, and has Gradle and Maven plugins. The main drawback is
that PITest is _noisy_, so there will be more build output than you might
expect.

After running a build using PITest, to see the mutation report (on passed or
failed mutation coverage), open:

* For Gradle, `build/reports/pitest/index.html`
* For Maven, `target/pit-reports/index.html`

### Tips

* Without further configuration, PITest defaults to mutating classes using
  your _project group_ as the package base. Example: Set the _project group_
  to "demo" for either Gradle or Maven if your classes are underneath the
  "demo.*" package namespace, otherwise PITest may complain that there are no
  classes to mutate, or no unit tests to run

---

## Use integration testing

**TODO**: Needs discussion

Plugins:

* For Gradle, use [_Gradle TestSets
  Plugin_](https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin)
* For Maven, use
  the [Maven Failsafe Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/failsafe/maven-failsafe-plugin/)

### Tips

* Failsafe shares the version number with Surefire. This project uses a
  shared `maven-testing-plugins.version` property
* Unlike `src/main/java` and `src/test/java`, there is no generally agreed
  convention for where to put integration tests. This project keeps all tests
  regardless of type in `src/test/java` for simplicity of presentation, naming
  integration tests with "*IT.java". A more sophisticated approach may make
  sense for your project
* Baeldung
  has [a good introduction article](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-failsafe-plugin)
  on Maven Failsafe

## Use automated live testing when appropriate

**TODO**: Needs discussion

- "Out of process tests"
- "System tests"
- Contrast live tests with E2E tests
